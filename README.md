# Development of Reference Percentile Growth Curves for Placental Parameters Using Advanced Statistical Models

This repository contains the resources related to the paper, titled "Development of Reference Percentile Growth Curves for Placental Parameters Using Advanced Statistical Models". In this study, the applicability of nonlinear regression models on growth curves of placental and fetal parameters was explored using a dataset of Portuguese parturients provided by CGC Genetics, Porto.


## Abstract

There has been a growing interest in assessing placental biometric parameters and their relationship with obstetric outcomes, highlighting their role in reflecting fetal development changes and influencing newborn and adult health. However, the research focuses on fetal development over the placental has caused many gaps in our knowledge about the biological role of placental abnormalities during childbirth and the first weeks after birth.
Considering the crucial role of growth charts in paediatric assessment, this study aims to explore nonlinear regression models for various biometric parameters of the placenta and fetus using data from Portuguese parturients to establish reference percentile growth curves. The flexibility of generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) and Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) methods, particularly their ability to accommodate diverse statistical distributions, allows the modelling of these parameters.

The application of the GAMLSS method with Box-Cox t (BCT) distribution and P-splines to Diameter 1, Diameter 2, Placental Volume, and FW/PW Ratio parameters, and LMS Box-Cox t (LMST) method to Placental Thickness, Placental Weight, and Fetal Weight parameters, results in representative percentile growth curves. These models accurately reflected the variability of placental biometric parameters over gestational age.

This study successfully developed placental growth curves using nonlinear regression models, providing valuable information into placental development and its clinical implications in obstetrics. The reference growth curves enhance the monitoring of maternal-fetal health and can guide clinical decisions, especially in addressing contemporary challenges such as low birth rates and increasing maternal age.

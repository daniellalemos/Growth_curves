## Model Performance Metrics for Placental Volume Using Different Methods

The table displays the R², MSE, AIC, and BIC.

|             | R²      | MSE     | AIC        | BIC        |
|-------------|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| **GAMLSS (BCT)** | **0.824** | **12.262** | **25112.430** | **25220.440** |
| GAMLSS (JSU) | 0.831   | 12.261  | 25149.710  | 25235.860  |
| LMST         | 0.824   | 12.268  | 25114.420  | 25228.040  |

Note: Developing growth curves for the PV parameter was challenging, as some models were unable to fit the data, such as the GAMLSS models with BCCG, BCPE, LMS, and LMSP.

## Model Performance Metrics for Fetal Weight Using Different Methods

The table displays the R², MSE, AIC, and BIC.

|                         | R²      | MSE     | AIC    | BIC    |
|-------------------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| GAMLSS (BCT)            | 0.961   | 13.100  | 26696  | 26872  |
| GAMLSS (JSU)            | 0.968   | 13.100  | 26788  | 26918  |
| **LMST**                | **0.962** | **13.110** | **26679** | **26874** |

Note: Developing growth curves for the FW parameter was challenging, as some models were unable to fit the data, such as the GAMLSS models with BCCG, BCPE, LMS, and LMSP.
